    instance.delete()
```

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **UserProfile.js**
```javascript
const handleDelete = async (id, title) => {
  const confirmMessage = `Are you sure you want to delete "${title}"?\n\nThis action cannot be undone!`;
  
  if (window.confirm(confirmMessage)) {
    setDeleting(id);
    try {
      await deleteBlog(id);
      toast.success('Blog deleted successfully!');
      await fetchBlogs({ author: user.id });
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error(error.response?.data?.detail || 'Failed to delete blog');
    } finally {
      setDeleting(null);
    }
  }
};
```

**Features:**
- Passes blog title to confirmation
- Tracks which blog is being deleted
- Refreshes list after deletion
- Shows detailed error messages

#### 2. **BlogDetail.js**
```javascript
const handleDelete = async () => {
  const confirmMessage = `Are you sure you want to delete "${selectedBlog.title}"?...`;
  
  if (window.confirm(confirmMessage)) {
    setDeleting(true);
    try {
      await deleteBlog(id);
      toast.success('Blog deleted successfully!');
      navigate('/'); // Redirect to home
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error(error.response?.data?.detail || 'Failed to delete blog');
      setDeleting(false);
    }
  }
};
```

**Features:**
- Only visible to blog author
- Redirects after deletion
- Clears selected blog
- Error recovery

#### 3. **store.js - Enhanced Delete Function**
```javascript
deleteBlog: async (id) => {
  set({ loading: true, error: null });
  try {
    await api.delete(`/blogs/blogs/${id}/`);
    // Remove from state immediately
    set((state) => ({
      blogs: state.blogs.filter(blog => blog.id !== id),
      selectedBlog: state.selectedBlog?.id === id ? null : state.selectedBlog,
      loading: false
    }));
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    const errorMsg = error.response?.data?.detail || 
                     error.response?.data?.error ||
                     'Failed to delete blog';
    set({ error: errorMsg, loading: false });
    throw error;
  }
},
```

**Improvements:**
- Updates state immediately
- Removes deleted blog from list
- Clears selectedBlog if it was deleted
- Better error messages
- Returns success boolean

### Backend Changes

#### **views.py - Added Permission Checks**
```python
def perform_destroy(self, instance):
    """Delete blog with author verification."""
    # Check if user is the author or admin
    if instance.author != self.request.user and not self.request.user.is_staff:
        from rest_framework.exceptions import PermissionDenied
        raise PermissionDenied("You don't have permission to delete this blog.")
    instance.delete()
```

**Security:**
- ✓ Verifies author ownership
- ✓ Allows admin deletion
- ✓ Returns 403 Forbidden if unauthorized
- ✓ Clear error message
