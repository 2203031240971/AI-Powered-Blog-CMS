## Implementation in Python
```python
import jwt
import datetime

# Generate token
payload = {
    'user_id': 123,
    'exp': datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(hours=24)
}
token = jwt.encode(payload, SECRET_KEY, algorithm='HS256')

# Verify token
try:
    decoded = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=['HS256'])
    user_id = decoded['user_id']
except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
    print("Token expired")
```

## Security Best Practices
- Short expiration times
- HTTPS only

## 🎨 **Blog Writing Best Practices**

### 1. **Structure Every Blog Similarly**

```
✅ Good Structure:
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Catchy Title                │
│ 2. Hook (First 2 sentences)    │
│ 3. Table of Contents           │
│ 4. Introduction (Problem)      │
│ 5. Main Content (Solution)     │
│    - Subheadings               │
│    - Code examples             │
│    - Diagrams                  │
│ 6. Practical Example           │
│ 7. Common Mistakes             │
│ 8. Conclusion                  │
│ 9. Resources/Links             │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. **Use Code Examples**

```python
# ✅ Good: Explained code with comments
def generate_blog_summary(content, max_words=150):
    """
    Generate AI summary for blog content.
    
    Args:
        content (str): Full blog content
        max_words (int): Maximum words in summary
    
    Returns:
        str: AI-generated summary
    """
    prompt = f"Summarize in {max_words} words: {content}"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Usage example
blog_content = "Long article about Django..."
summary = generate_blog_summary(blog_content, 100)
print(summary)
```

### 3. **Add Visual Elements**

- Screenshots of output
- Architecture diagrams
- Flowcharts
- Code diff comparisons
- Tables for comparisons

### 4. **Optimize for SEO**

```
✅ Title: "Understanding JWT Authentication in 2025: Complete Guide"
   - Clear, keyword-rich
   - Year for freshness
   - "Complete Guide" for intent

✅ Meta Description (AI Summary):
   "Learn JWT authentication with practical examples. This guide 
   covers token generation, verification, security best practices, 
   and implementation in Django & Express.js."

✅ Keywords:
   - JWT authentication
   - Token-based auth
   - API security
   - Django authentication
```

---

## 🤖 **AI Summary Generation Tips**

### **When to Use AI Summaries:**

✅ **DO use for:**
- Long technical tutorials (1500+ words)
- Complex explanations needing simplification
- Blog previews in list view
- Meta descriptions for SEO

❌ **DON'T use for:**
- Very short posts (< 500 words)
- Personal stories that lose meaning when summarized
- Code-heavy content without context

### **How to Write Content for Better AI Summaries:**

```
✅ Good Original Content:
"JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing 
claims to be transferred between two parties. It consists of three 
parts separated by dots: Header, Payload, and Signature. The header 
contains the algorithm used, the payload contains the claims (user data), 
and the signature ensures integrity."

AI Summary Generated:
"JWT is a secure token format with three parts: Header (algorithm), 
Payload (user data), and Signature (integrity check). It enables 
stateless authentication between client and server."

✅ Result: Clear, accurate, useful


❌ Bad Original Content:
"So like, JWT is this thing that does stuff with tokens and it's 
pretty cool I guess. You use it for logging in and stuff. There's 
some parts to it but I'm not sure exactly..."

AI Summary Generated:
"JWT is a token-based authentication mechanism used for user login."

❌ Result: Too generic, loses important details
```
