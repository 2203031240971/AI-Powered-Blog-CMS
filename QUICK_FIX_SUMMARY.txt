PROBLEM:
  When clicking "Register" button, nothing was showing.

ROOT CAUSE:
  Toast notifications were not displaying because ToastContainer
  was missing from the App.js file.

WHAT I FIXED:
  ✅ Added ToastContainer to App.js
  ✅ Added toast CSS imports
  ✅ Improved error handling
  ✅ Added console logging for debugging
  ✅ Better success/error messages

FILES MODIFIED:
  - frontend/src/App.js
  - frontend/src/pages/Register.js
  - frontend/src/pages/Login.js

HOW TO TEST:

1. RESTART FRONTEND:
   → Go to frontend terminal
   → Press Ctrl+C
   → Run: npm start

2. TEST REGISTRATION:
   → Go to http://localhost:3000
   → Click "Register"
   → Fill in form:
     First Name: John
     Last Name: Doe
     Username: johndoe
     Email: john@example.com
     Password: Test1234
     Confirm Password: Test1234
   → Click "Register"
   → You should see ✅ success message!

3. TEST LOGIN:
   → Click "Login"
   → Enter username and password
   → Click "Sign In"
   → You should see ✅ success message!

4. CREATE BLOG:
   → After login, click "Create Blog"
   → Write your post
   → Publish!

WHAT YOU'LL SEE NOW:

✅ Green toast notification when registration succeeds
✅ Automatic redirect to login page
✅ Green toast notification when login succeeds
✅ Redirect to home page
✅ Can create blog posts!

DEBUGGING:

If still having issues:
  1. Open browser console (F12)
  2. Look for console.log messages
  3. Check Network tab for API calls
  4. Check backend terminal for errors

COMMON ERRORS:

❌ "Username already exists" → Use different username
❌ "Email already exists" → Use different email
❌ "Password too common" → Use stronger password
❌ "Passwords don't match" → Make sure they match
❌ "Password too short" → Use 8+ characters

STATUS: ✅ FIXED & READY TO TEST
