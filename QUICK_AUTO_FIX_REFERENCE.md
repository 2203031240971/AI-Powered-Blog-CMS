## Real Example

"Blog won't save. When I fill out the blog creation form
and click Publish, I get an error 'Failed to create blog'.
The console shows 'JSON.parse is not a function'."
```

### My Response:
```
Found the issue! In backend/apps/blogs/serializers.py,
the tag_ids parsing is failing.

FIXED: Changed JSON parsing to handle both string and array formats.

Test: Try creating a blog now. 
It should save successfully and appear in your profile.
```

```
"Yes! Blog created and shows in profile. Thanks!"
