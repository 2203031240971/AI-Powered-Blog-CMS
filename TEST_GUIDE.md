## 🌐 Test #2: API Testing (Advanced)

### Test if backend API is responding

```powershell
# Test 1: API Root Endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/

# Expected: Shows all available endpoints
# If you see error: Backend not running
```

```powershell
# Test 2: Register New User
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/register/ `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{
    "username":"testuser",
    "email":"test@example.com",
    "password":"Test123!",
    "password2":"Test123!"
  }'

# Expected: User created message with ID
# If error: Check backend console for details
```

```powershell
# Test 3: Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login/ `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{
    "username":"testuser",
    "password":"Test123!"
  }'

# Expected: Returns access and refresh tokens
# If 401 error: Username/password wrong or user not created
```

```powershell
# Test 4: View Blogs (No login needed)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/blogs/blogs/

# Expected: Returns list of blogs (even if empty)
# If error: Database issue
```

---

## 💻 Test #3: Browser Console (F12)

### Open DevTools
```
Press: F12 (Windows/Linux)
Or: Cmd+Option+I (Mac)
```

### Check These Tabs

#### Console Tab
```
✅ NO RED ERRORS = Good
❌ RED ERRORS = Problem

Look for:
- "Failed to fetch"
- "404 Not Found"
- "CORS error"
- "Uncaught TypeError"
```

#### Network Tab
```
Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
Look at request list
Check Status column:

✅ 200 = Success
✅ 201 = Created
❌ 404 = Not Found
❌ 401 = Unauthorized
❌ 500 = Server Error
```

#### Application Tab
```
Under "Local Storage"
Look for:
- access_token (after login)
- refresh_token (after login)

✅ Present = Token stored correctly
❌ Missing = Login failed
```
